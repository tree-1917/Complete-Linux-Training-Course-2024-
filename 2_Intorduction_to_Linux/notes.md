### 8. What is Operating System?

- What is Operating System ?
  - An operating system (OS) is a software program that `serves as an intermediary` between computer `hardware` and **user applications**. It **manages** the computer's hardware resources, provides common services for computer programs, and allows users to interact with the computer.
- What is primary functions for Os ?

  1. **Process Management:** The OS manages processes, which are running instances of programs. It allocates resources, such as CPU time and memory, to processes and ensures they run efficiently.

  2. **Memory Management:** The OS handles memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring that programs have access to the memory they need and that memory is used efficiently.

  3. **File System Management:** It provides a way for programs and users to store, retrieve, and organize files on storage devices such as hard drives and SSDs. This includes managing directories, file permissions, and file metadata.

  4. **Device Management:** The OS controls and communicates with hardware devices such as printers, disk drives, and network adapters, allowing programs to interact with these devices without needing to know specific details about each device.

  5. **User Interface:** The OS provides a user interface, which can range from a simple command-line interface to a graphical user interface (GUI) with windows, icons, and menus. This interface allows users to interact with the computer and run programs.

- What is Type of Operating Systems ?

  - Desktop Os

    - **Personal computer** software for tasks like word processing, web browsing. Examples: Windows, macOS.

  - Server OS

    - **Optimized** for running server applications, managing network **resources**. Examples: Windows Server, Linux.

  - Mobile Os

    - Designed for `smartphones`, tablets, `emphasizing` touchscreens, app stores. Examples: Android, iOS.

  - Embedded Os

    - `Tailored` for specific functions in devices like consumer electronics, IoT. Examples: Embedded Linux, `FreeRTOS`.

  - Real-Time Os

    - `Processes data`, responds within guaranteed time frame. Essential for timing `predictability`. Examples: VxWorks, FreeRTOS.

### 9. What is Linux?
