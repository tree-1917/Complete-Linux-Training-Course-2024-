## 156. DNS - Download, Install and Configure (Domain Name Systems) üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### What is **DNS**?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1), allowing browsers to locate and access websites.

### How to Install and Configure **DNS**?

1. **Install DNS Server:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install bind9
   ```

2. **Configure DNS Server:**

   Edit the main configuration file `/etc/bind/named.conf` and zone files:

   - **/etc/bind/named.conf**: Main configuration.
   - **/var/cache/bind/db.local**: Local DNS records.

3. **Restart DNS Service:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart bind9
   ```

### How to Create a **DNS** Using Shell Script? üñ•Ô∏è

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Bind9
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bind9

# Create a basic DNS zone configuration
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/bind/named.conf.local
zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/zones/db.example.com";
};
EOF

# Create the zone file
sudo mkdir -p /etc/bind/zones
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/bind/zones/db.example.com
\$TTL 86400
@   IN  SOA example.com. root.example.com. (
            1   ; Serial
       3600   ; Refresh
        1800   ; Retry
      1209600   ; Expire
        86400 ) ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@   IN  NS  ns.example.com.
@   IN  A   192.0.2.1
ns  IN  A   192.0.2.1
EOF

# Restart Bind9 to apply changes
