### 32. Take a snapshot of VM

> üì∏ Taking a Snapshot of a Virtual Machine

Taking a snapshot of a VM allows you to capture the current state of the VM, including its memory, settings, and disk state. This is useful for creating backups, testing, or saving a particular state of the VM to revert to later.

#### Prerequisites

- A hypervisor or virtualization software (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V).
- An existing virtual machine.

#### Steps for Different Virtualization Software

##### üñ•Ô∏è VirtualBox

1. **Open VirtualBox:**
   Open the VirtualBox application.

2. **Select the VM:**
   Select the virtual machine you want to take a snapshot of from the list on the left.

3. **Take a Snapshot:**

   - üõ†Ô∏è Click on the **Snapshots** button.
   - ‚ûï Click on the **Take** icon or right-click the VM and select **Take Snapshot**.
   - ‚úèÔ∏è **Name your snapshot** and optionally add a description.
   - üì∏ Click **OK** to create the snapshot.

   **Command:**

   ```sh
   VBoxManage snapshot "VM Name" take "Snapshot Name" --description "Snapshot Description"
   ```

##### üñ•Ô∏è VMware

1. **Open VMware Workstation/Player:**
   Open the VMware application.

2. **Select the VM:**
   Select the virtual machine you want to snapshot.

3. **Take a Snapshot:**

   - ‚ûï Click **Snapshot** and then **Take Snapshot**.
   - ‚úèÔ∏è **Name your snapshot** and optionally add a description.
   - üì∏ Click **OK** to create the snapshot.

   **Command (for VMware Workstation Pro):**

   ```sh
   vmrun -T ws snapshot "path/to/vm.vmx" "Snapshot Name"
   ```

##### üñ•Ô∏è Hyper-V

1. **Open Hyper-V Manager:**
   Open the Hyper-V Manager application.

2. **Select the VM:**
   Select the virtual machine you want to snapshot from the list.

3. **Take a Snapshot:**

   - üõ†Ô∏è Right-click the VM and select **Checkpoint**.
   - ‚úèÔ∏è **Name your checkpoint** and optionally add a description.
   - üì∏ Click **OK** to create the checkpoint.

   **Command:**

   ```powershell
   Checkpoint-VM -Name "VM Name" -SnapshotName "Snapshot Name"
   ```

##### ü§î Why Take Snapshots?

- **Backup and Recovery:** Easily revert to a known good state if something goes wrong.
- **Testing and Development:** Create multiple states of a VM for testing different configurations or updates.
- **System Upgrades:** Safeguard your current state before performing major upgrades or changes.

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
